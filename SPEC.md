# Gleaning — Spec

## Purpose

A personal web app to capture and recall beautiful sentences and paragraphs — from books, videos, conversations, or anywhere.
The core loop: encounter something worth keeping → type it → find it later.

---

## Users

**Phase 1 (now):** Single user (yourself). Private, invite-only.
**Phase 2 (later):** Open to others, potentially monetized.

All data is user-scoped from day one so Phase 2 requires no data model changes.

## Core Concepts

### Source
Where a quote came from. A source is optional — sometimes you don't know or don't care.

| Source Type | Fields                                          | Example                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `book`      | title, author (optional), page (optional)       | *Meditations*, Marcus Aurelius, p.42 |
| `video`     | title, author/speaker (optional), url (optional)| YouTube talk, interview       |
| `live`      | author/speaker (optional), context (optional)   | Heard at a talk, conversation |
| `unknown`   | —                                               | No idea where it came from    |

Books are the primary source type and get first-class treatment (dedicated shelf view).

### Book
A book has its own record separate from a source, enabling the shelf view and quote grouping.

| Field      | Type   | Required | Notes                          |
|------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------|
| title      | string | yes      |                                |
| author     | string | no       |                                |
| language   | enum   | no       | `en` or `zh`                   |
| cover_url  | string | no       | URL to a cover image           |

### Quote
A sentence or paragraph worth keeping.

| Field      | Type     | Required | Notes                                    |
|------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| text       | string   | yes      | The quote itself                         |
| source     | Source   | no       | Where it came from (any type above)      |
| author     | string   | no       | Who said/wrote it (if not via a source)  |
| page       | integer  | no       | Page number (books only)                 |
| tags       | string[] | no       | Optional labels, e.g. "grief", "time"    |
| created_at | date     | auto     | When it was entered                      |

## Features

### 1. Quote Entry (primary action — must be fast)
- **Text** is the only required field — everything else is optional
- Optionally attach a source:
  - **Book:** searchable dropdown of existing books + page number field; can create a new book inline (title, optional author, optional language)
  - **Video:** title + optional URL
  - **Live:** speaker + optional context note
  - **Unknown:** no fields
- Optionally add tags (comma or Enter to add, Backspace to remove)
- Submit with ⌘↵ (no mouse required)
- Global shortcut **⌘E** opens the add-quote modal from anywhere in the app

### 2. Quote Feed
- One quote at a time, centered on screen
- **Space** or the arrow button advances to the next quote
- Quotes cycle through in chronological order (most recent first)
- **Display mode** — hides the nav and add button for a distraction-free reading experience:
  - Desktop: press **F** to toggle, **Esc** to exit
  - Mobile: **double-tap** the quote card to toggle
- Newly added quotes appear instantly without a page reload

### 3. Shelf (Browse by Book)
- Grid of all books with cover images (if available) and quote counts
- Tap a book → quotes sorted by page number
- Quotes added from within a book's page are pre-linked to that book

### 4. Keyword Search
- Single search bar, always accessible via **⌘K**

## Out of Scope (for now)

- Open registration (Phase 1 = your account only)
- Payments / subscriptions
- Export (PDF, CSV, etc.)
- Mobile native app
- Ebook import or OCR
- Spaced repetition / flashcards
- Public profiles
- Social / sharing features

## UX Principles

1. **Speed of entry is the most important thing.** If adding a quote takes more than 5 seconds, the user won't do it mid-reading.
2. **Minimal required fields.** Only the quote text is required. Everything else is optional.
3. **Keyboard-first.** Tab between fields, ⌘↵ to submit, shortcuts for everything common.
4. **No clutter.** This is a reading companion, not a productivity app. Keep it calm and focused.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should books have genres/categories?
- [ ] Should quotes support images (e.g., a photo of the page)?
- [ ] What happens when the same book has multiple editions with different page numbers?
- [ ] Should tags be free-form or from a fixed list?
